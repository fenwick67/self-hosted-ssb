# ssb-web
a self-hosted single-user SSB client

This is a work in progress but might be a good reference for somebody getting into SSB and trying to interface with pull-streams.

## TODOs / notes

clicking on a user's feed from another user's feed doesn't work because the route doesn't change, need to eatch route in view controller
